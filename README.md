Tracks my ongoing research in human cognitive ecology. Documents various theoretical frameworks, including 'detextualization,' attention formation, push-driven external memory systems, operant ecology, and AI as an emergent species. Repository is designed to make in-progress work available for immediate engagement, collaboration, and citation.
