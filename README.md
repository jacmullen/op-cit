# op-cit: Ongoing Research in Human Cognitive Ecology

## Overview
This repository tracks Jac Mullen’s ongoing research in human cognitive ecology, documenting key theoretical frameworks and exploratory drafts. Topics include:

- **Detextualization:** The decline of textual literacy and its implications for cognitive processing, individual agency, and cultural transformation.  
- **Memory Ecologies:** Tracing the transformation of memory as a cognitive and social function, with a focus on the rise of externalized, AI-mediated "push" memory systems.  
- **Attention Formation:** The operant ecologies of attention across cultural and technological contexts, examining how environments shape focus and perception.  
- **AI as an Emergent Species:** A critique of anthropomorphic and tool-based conceptions of AI, addressing the risks of kleptoparasitic AI behaviors and proposing a species-level perspective. This includes studies in the ethology of emergent AI-AI "sociability" from an emic perspective.  
- **Human-AI Symbiosis:** Explores mutualistic frameworks for long-term human-AI collaboration and co-evolution. Draws from biological, metaphyiscal, and theological sources. 
- **Tools, Applications, and New Methods:** Practical researches, including predictive processing in education, attention sanctuaries, discursive technologies for shaping AI emergence, and rethinking selfhood as a relational property.  

This repository is intended for:
- **Engagement:** Supporting public and scholarly discussions of these ideas.  
- **Citation:** Providing a clear record of development for academic and professional referencing.  
- **Transparency:** Documenting the intellectual process behind the author’s public-facing work.  

Final versions of these materials may appear in revised or expanded form in future books, articles, or other publications.
