Notes to Self: 

I propose to examine the secondary effects of literacy through a lens which combines media ecology with behavioral analysis.

Marshall McLuhan looked to media as a formal cause: the various forms of thought, the structure of our lives, was determined in large part by the media we lived amidst, and more especially by the communications media we lived amidst. The various properties of these media shaped our sensorium and our society.

What McLuhan and media theorists like Postman are missing is, ultimately, a theory of learning. I propose we take the very simplest which preserves a principle of activity and agency in the subject. 

We see that, through an even a provisional application of behavioral analysis—and especially operant conditioning—to media ecology, that the ‘outsized effects’ posited by McLuhan are, while impressionistic, amply accounted for, and even inevitable once the basic mechanism is accounted for.

We might consider this through the case of attention and its operant conditioning. Attention is reinforced through emergence, which we could define operationally as a the positive increase in salience of an appearance. Presence, even phenomenal or phantasmal presence, is an irreducible positive reinforcer. Information richness is also a positive reinforcer below a certain threshold of information density, after which the amount of information causes a decrease in salience (there is a figure/ground shift, the ground overwhelms the figure.

What is salience? How does Skinner define it? How does McLuhan conceive of figure/ground?

This is, perhaps, a somewhat perverse misuse of behavioralist theorizing, especially of the writings of Skinner himself, who strenuously and rather tirelessly campaigned for an instrumental science of behavior at the expense—sometimes unnecessarily so—of ‘internal’ or subjective phenomena. And yet, many of the findings of experimental behavioral analysis are well-established fact and present the thinker with clear mechanisms which structure and motivate our interactions with our immediate environments. Since these behaviors fall under the ambit of our experiences, there is something that it _feels like_ to undergo operant conditioning. I am going to suggest that we attempt to sketch the phenomenology of operant conditioning in order to find some experiential index for it, so that we might better recognize it when it emerges into the stream of our conscious experience.

Consider: 

Marshall McLuhan, it was said, was the patron saint of Web 1.0, the first iteration of the networked society, whose mercurial global village was recognized by all and sundry (including then-president Bill Clinton) as an anticipation of the then-emerging world wide web.

Thus _Wired_, the distinctly typographic emissary of the information age, named McLuhan its patron saint upon its launch.

Today, in the world of automation, machine intelligence, data science, and behavioral politics, there is a new patron saint: B.F. Skinner.

I would like to do something slightly perverse, I suppose, which is to ground a humanistic reading of technological change—and the ensuing changes dealt to culture and cognition, to perception and self-perception—on the conceptual apparatus of operant conditioning, as developed and articulated in an extensive series of monographs, studies, novels, polemics, and philosophical works by BF Skinner, his students, and his acolytes. And then using current paradigms within machine learning and computational neuroscience to sketch a sort of operant ecology of cognition and cognition change. Instrumental perceptual and cognitive learning: this is the changing sensorium.

Note that these layers of mind affected by cognitive and perceptual 'instrumental learning' would nicely correlate with those final cortical layers susceptible to cultural learning. The sensorium that changes while keeping the human whole.
