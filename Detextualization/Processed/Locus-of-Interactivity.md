# 02.20.23 Locus of Interactivity

A vast literature exists documenting the profound effects of literacy acquisition on the human brain. If we are to honestly meet the challenges posed by the ongoing de-textualization of language, we must identify the secondary effects of literacy and textuality at the individual, interpersonal, and collective levels, and then creatively adapt our educational practices to ensure that, even without fluent literacy, younger generations still acquire the beneficial traits and behaviors first spread broadly through the population by typographic literacy.

# LOCUS OF INTERACTIVITY 

**My hypothesis is that new communications technologies fundamentally transform the loci of interactivity in a given human environment. By simply creating a new locus of interactivity, each new technology invariably occasions an intensive process of operant conditioning.** This interaction should be conceived as a form of operant emission, components of which will be selectively reinforced by contingencies derivative of the structure, form and content of the communications medium/object (e.g. a book) and its message (e.g. the text). Any new tech or device—be it the printed book or the smartphone—would function here as operant conditioning chambers which shape behavior through contingencies of reinforcement (and schedules of reinforcement) intrinsic to the structure, function and content of the new technology. This seems to follow logically from the nature of operant omissions and the fact that communications media are hubs of maximal interactivity within any given human environment.

I am looking right now at ways of measuring the loci of interactivity within different environments. At core it's actually just a matter of measuring the differential distribution of human cognitive and behavioral attention across a given environment. I have looked at interactivity in communications, organizational design, product design, and video game/vr contexts. The argument is rather straightforward. The more reactive a part of the environment is—the more that interaction with it provides reinforcement of any number of kinds—the more likely it is to shape and change behavior through reinforcement learning. If there's an environment, and the pigeon is motivated, and there is a way of acquiring a reinforcer in the environment—if the pigeon finds the reinforcer, its behavior will begin to be shaped by the acquisition of the reinforcer. Now, with humans, we have people who tell us where to find the reinforcers. We know where the level is and what it does. We learn how to use it, then we teach others so they can use it. This is assuming they have areas with levers as well. If not, we will sometimes start manufacturing and distributing operant conditioning chambers because we imagine it streamlines pellet acquisition overall.

I am arguing that new communications technologies do not necessarily directly condition cognitive, perceptual or physical behavior at scale. Rather, they change the locus of interactivity—the most attended to, reactive elements in an observer's environment—within a given environment, and thus radically change the contingencies of reinforcement available in the environment. Sometimes these new technologies also become the loci of interactivity, in which case they do directly condition behavior. In other cases, they merely displace the existing loci and clear the space for new loci to emerge.

For instance: the invention of writing centralizes the control system for a human collective, and thus makes the physical and natural environment less interactive and dynamic, as it helps to create manageable, uniform, predictable throughputs for food production which operate according to non-local directives. Now, you could analyze this in a number of ways, and how exactly the loci of interactivity change, but for the sake of this brief message, let this stand as one end of a spectrum of the possible consequences of new tech changing the loci of interactivity. On the other end of the spectrum, you have cases like print typography or natural language programs where the new information technologies not only displace old loci, but the tech themselves become the new loci. Thus, the formal and perceptual properties of the system shape perceptual, cognitive and physical behavior, while transformations to the range and nature of messages the new tech is capable of sending also has an overall effect.

Each shift along this continuum does NOT equally shift the locus of interactivity in a given environment. Or, it might SHIFT it, but each shift does not equally CONSTITUTE THE NEW LOCUS AS WELL.

With early writing, the locus of interactivity was shifted such that close social proximity with little control over outcomes of interactions (of food getting, of sociability, of infant lives) became the norm. This clear out old loci, and created space where new ones emerged.

With print, however, the loci of interactivity became the new form of language processing itself, in print typographic objects. Print typography became the means of interacting with all manner of ongoing events, people, traders, neighbors, and opened up new virtual environments whose affordances and contingencies derived in part from the nature of the typographic object/experience itself. It also became the primary means of interacting with the self.

Finally, this changes again with digital media, and digital media also constitutes a change of the loci of interactivity that are also themselves the new loci of interactivity.

# Shaping Cognition Through Shifting the Loci of Interactivity 

1) The environment shapes behavior.

2) Different environments shape different behaviors.

3) Changes in the environment lead to changes in behavior.

4) There exist in any environment loci of interactivity. A locus of interactivity is a portion, area, surface, feature, object etc. within an observer’s environment which, in its ability to provide feedback, constitutes a local maximum.

5) New information technologies transform human environments.

6) New behaviors arise as a result of the environmental changes.

7) New information technologies do not directly ‘transform’ human cognition, perception or behavior. Rather, such technologies transform the human environment, and the transformed environment engenders new cognitive, perceptual, and physical behaviors.

8) New information technology transforms the human environment by altering the distribution of interactivity across the human environment. New distributions of interactivity create new contingencies of reinforcement. New contingencies of reinforcement shape operant emissions into new behavioral topographies.


# Inevitable Consequences of Detextualization 

If detextualization proceeds, it will lead to unavoidable cognitive, perceptual and behavioral changes across people and at scale. 

1)    Social organization is, to a significant extent, determined and shaped by the technologies for information processing and communication that comprise the language and media of its control system.

2)    Behavior is shaped by the environment. Behaviors are differentially selected for and shaped by the contingences of reinforcement that exist in a given environment. When the environment changes (when new resources become available, or new means of accessing existing resources are contrived, or new means of creating, storing, or exchanging information are devised, or improvements in the processing of materials, energy or information evolve or are discovered), the ‘selection pressures’ within the environment shift as well. New contingencies of reinforcement shape and differentially select new behaviors. Old behaviors are led to extinction. Once-salient stimuli recede into the grey hum of the background.

3)    Individual people are, to a significant extent, determined and shaped by their environments.

4)    Social reality is, to a significant extent, determined and shaped by the regularities (relative minima and maxima) achieved by predictive perceptual and cognitive mechanisms of the mind operating on existing experiential data, considered across the population as a whole (or its sectors, as in parts). To the extent that control is non-localized and invisible, while physical, perceptual and social novelty remains low, the auto-predictive operations of the mind will increasingly seize onto small local observed variations in the immediate environment—be it meteorological anomalies, or changes in the patterns of visitation of strangers, or even micro-expressions in interlocutors—and relate these causally to the experienced consequences—both pleasurable and aversive—of the opaque control system.

5)    Innovations that touch the processing of information, and especially of language, have an especially significant impact on the human environment, and thus too on behavior.

6)    New communication and information processing technologies shift the loci of interactivity within the human environment.

7)    Detextualization will change the social organization. To change social organization is to change the human environment, which will change human behavior at physical, perceptual, and cognitive levels. There will develop new ideas and modes of being which reflect the behavioral changes.

8)    The marginalization of writing necessarily entails the marginalization of reading.

9)    Language remains a vital pre-processing technology for rendering perceptual data suitable inputs for cognitive operations.

10)  Orthographic literacy, and the vast machinery of behavioral engineering which, historically, enabled its use as a universal information processing technology, will become an increasingly marginal and esoteric pursuit.

# Loci of Interactivity and Operant Cognitive Behaviors 

I am curious about investigating what I call 'cognitive' behaviors in humans. I think there is a very similar dynamic at work—there are 'perceptual emissions' (we see this in how, e.g., by staring at something, certain bizarre visual effects can start to occur), for instance, and I bet there are also something we could call perceptual reinforcers. This process is in a sense identical to the conditioning of an animal's attention so that it responds to e.g. a particular colored disk vs. disks of other colors, which was is a common practice in behavioralist laboratory work (and closely related to the process of bringing a conditioned behavior under the control of a specific stimulus). I am curious as to the specific class of reinforcers 'native' or 'intrinsic' to perception. For instance, I suspect that the successful decoding of a message encoded within a sensory array (for instance, from reading a printed word) is reinforcing. I am curious to close this space between externally observable whole-organism 'behavior' and this sort of cognitive or perceptual behavior. I believe that the very existence of successful 'self-learning' artificial neural networks in a sense offer proof-of-concept that reinforcement learning mechanisms operate on cognitive or perceptual behavior.

For instance, I believe that curiosity is a type of informational motivation, and the satisfaction of curiosity a reinforcer. Meanwhile, the means by which satisfaction of curiosity was achieved will be reinforced. The perceptual behavior will be reinforced (say, scanning a line of text within a uniform grid of alphabetic code, superimposed on an optic display, during which foveal inputs and letter form inputs will be amplified across the system, and other non-overlapping non-salient inputs inhibited), and the cognitive behavior will be reinforced (say, of decoding the text to extract the message, which involves the activation of pathways connecting the letterform area in the visual cortex to areas involved in semantic processing). I do think perceptual and cognitive culturally dependent differences at scale result from differences in how resources and reinforcers are accessed within these societies (not exclusively, or even directly, of course, but there should be a non-trivial association between certain human-environmental configurations and certain cognitive or behavioral traits).
